# Unit 11 Homework: Web Visualization Dashboard
###      Web - Design Challenge

Create a website by using either the visualizations that you created for your Python-APIs Challenge or the weather data and images that are provided for this Challenge using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Also the dashboard that features the Latitude vs. X analysis of weather.

##  Website consist of seven pages as follows:

1. A landing page containing:
    An explanation of the project.
    Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

2. Four visualization pages, each with:
        A descriptive title and a heading tag.
        The visualization for the selected comparison (latitude vs. max temperature, latitude vs. humidity, latitude vs. cloudiness, or latitude vs. wind speed).
        A paragraph describing the visualization and its significance

3. A "Comparisons" page that has following:
        Contains all the visualizations on the same page so that people can easily compare them.
        Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations. This grid must contain two visualizations across a medium or large screen and one visualization across an extra-small or small screen.

4. A "Data" displays a responsive table containing the data that the visualizations use, as follow
        Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
        The table must be a bootstrap table component. 
        Hint: The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method appropriately called to_html that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe.  
        
5. At the top of every page, your website must have a navigation bar that does the following:

        Contains the name of the site on the left side of the navigation bar, allowing users to return to the landing page from any page.
        Contains a drop-down menu, named Plots, on the right side of the navigation bar that contains a link to each visualization page.
        Provides two more text links on the right side: Comparisons, which links to the comparisons page, and Data, which links to the data page.
        Is responsive (via media queries). Note that the navigation bar must resemble the one in the screenshots in the Navigation Bar Links to an external site. section. In particular, notice the background color change.

5. Finally,Your website must be deployed to GitHub Pages.
